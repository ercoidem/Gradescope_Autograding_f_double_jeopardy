1. Run Getting_PDF.py to get student pdfs, this helps me input it into a new test course on gradescope. Group students' result so that you get student name, sorting number and the value they've writen on their lab reports.
2. Open Library_for_student_values_and_name.py, change cookie, urls to get correct links
3. Open Main_for_grading.py to translate rubrics to python language
4. Open Final_Run_this_one.py, change pyautogui parts that fit the screen resolution and size
5. Open a google chrome browser with no open websites, run the program and minimum you IDE so that browser is on the top,  enjoy!

Notifications:
1.judgers.py is for judging methods to be used in Main_for_grading.py, it's not complete, you may edit it.
2. Grading on gradescope website is achieved by pyautogui, which deprives you of control over the computer, pls just leave it running when grading
